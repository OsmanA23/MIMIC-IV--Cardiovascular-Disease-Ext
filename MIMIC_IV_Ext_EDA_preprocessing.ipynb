the left ventricle and diffuse FDG uptake involving the right ventricle 2 Extensive FDG avid lymphadenopathy 3 Numerous pulmonary nodules, some of which are FDG avid Cardiac Perfusion Rest FINDINGS The image quality is overall adequate The left ventricular cavity size is normal Gated images show a mild defect in the basal portion of the inferior wall in the presence of soft tissue attenuation Mild decreased activity in the septum probably due to patient s abnormal conduction defect IMPRESSION Probably normal cardiac perfusion study in the presence of soft tissue attenuation in the inferior wall , Conclusions The left atrium is normal in size The interatrial septum is aneurysmal There is mild non obstructive focal hypertrophy of the basal septum The left ventricular cavity size is normal Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed LVEF 45 % with hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior wall LV involvement of ARVC versus Pseudohypokinesis from IVCD versus CAD Left ventricular dysnchrony is present No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva There is no ventricular septal defect The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with at least midlly depressed free wall contractility There is abnormal septal motion/position due to IVCD in part and possibly a component of RV dilation/volume overload The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level The ascending aorta is mildly dilated The aortic valve leaflets 3 appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation There is no mitral valve prolapse The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal There is no pericardial effusion IMPRESSION Mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction with regional variation see differential diagnosis above Moderately dilated right ventricle with at least mild systolic dysfunction Mildly dilated thoracic aorta EP Brief Procedure Report Findings rfv and lfv HV 69 ms AV block no retrograde conduction No atrial arrhythmias induced VT induced
